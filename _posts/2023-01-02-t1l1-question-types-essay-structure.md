# IELTS writing task 1 Lesson 1

## Course aims

- methods and techniques
- break the task into parts

**Remember:**

The task is to **describe** what you see. Write a **report**. Don't give opinions.

No conclusion. Instead write a summary (the overview).

## Question types

1. Line graph
2. Bar chart
3. Pie chart
4. Table
5. Diagram - comparing
6. Diagram - process

The No.1 ~ No.4 have one thing in common which is they all show **numbers**.

There are three things in terms of language that we need to really worry about:

- describe (the numbers)
- compare (between the numbers)
- changes / trends (of the numbers)

## Essay structure

4 paragraphs:

1. Introduction
2. Overview
3. Details
4. Details

### 1. Introduction

One sentence: **Paraphrase the question**

> paraphrase -- express the same message in different words

What do we do in the introduction? Very simple, just one sentence paraphrasing the question. So you take the question and go through it bit by bit changing the words if you can. Maybe change the order. You donâ€™t have to change everything, just trying to change the key words in there.

### 2. Overview

Two sentences: **The main, general things**

What do we do in the overvie or summary? It's important so we give it two sentences. You're going to explain or describe the main general things. So look for two main things (points). 

### 3+4. Details

This is where you include numbers and you do your comparisons, your describing trends if there are trends shown.

Why do we nees two paragraphs to describe details?

**This makes you organise or 'group' the information better.**

For example, if you've got numbers you might put all the higher numbers in one paragraph and the lower numbers in another; or you might put the first half of the period in paragraph three and the second half of the period of yearss in paragraph four. Just grouping and organizing, this will help your score for **coherence** and **cohesion**, makes your structure look better.

> coherence --  logical and orderly and consistent relation of parts
>
> cohesion -- the state of cohering or sticking together

*No conclusion!*
