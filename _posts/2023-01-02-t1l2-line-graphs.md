# IELTS writing task 1 Lesson 2

Line graphs show numbers over a period of time, so you will always see numbers on the left on the y axis, and time on the bottom on the x axis, and lines on the graph show the numbers changing going up and downas as the time goes on.

One thing you need to know before we start is that you will not see a graph with only one line in your IELTS test. A graph with only one line would be too easy. You will almost definitely see 2, 3, 4 or even 5 lines on the line graph, usually the most common are graphs with 3 or 4 lines.

## Compare the lines

Your job is to compare the lines, not to describe them separately. Do not write a separate paragraph about each of the lines, make sure you compare them. There's two types of comparison that you need to make:

- **First, make a very general comparison** of the lines on the graph of the information. This is for your summary or overview paragraph. I do this after the introduction as paragraph 2.

![general comparison](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/4lines1.png){: w="60%" .normal}

An example of this if we take a graph with four lines, the overall summary would be something very very general. Like saying that the blue line is the highest overall, it's highter than the other lines overall in the while period shown.

- **Second, compare the lines at specific points**. This is for your "details" paragraphs, paragraphs 3 and 4.

Looking again at the graph for an example, with these four lines, there many details that you could compare. 

![beginning](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/4lines2.png){: w="60%" .normal}

I would start off at the beginning with the first year and compare the numbers there, but then there many other choices and you have to select what you think of the main things. 

![blue one](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/4lines3.png){: w="50%" .noraml}

You might choose this point, where the blue line becomes the highest and stays the highest fot the rest of the period. 

![increases or rises](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/4lines4.png){: w="50%" .normal}

You might choose to describe and compare the different increases or rises.

![peaks](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/4lines5.png){: w="50%" .normal}

You might choose the peaks on one or more of the lines.

![stable period](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/4lines6.png){: w="50%" .normal}

You might choose a stable period on one of the lines like this one.

There are many things to say and you can't describe everything, so you have to select. 

My tip is write at least one thing about each line. Make sure you do some comparisons and if you've got one or two things that you've said about each line that should be okay.

## Line graph question

Here's the question. The graph below shows electricity production (in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012.

![stable period](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/linegraphquestion.png){: w="80%" .normal}

### 4 paragraphs

#### **1. Introduction - paraphrase the question**

For the Introduction we paraphrase the question and we just change some words. 
So the main thing to look at is the question statement, here the graph below shows, electricity, production, and terawatt hours in France between 1980 and 2012. 
And we’re going to just try and change a few words in there.

![introduction](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/introduction.png)

We start with "the graph below shows" we can change that to "the line graph compares". 

Then "electricity production" we can change that to "the amount of electricity produced". 

I'll miss out "in terawatt hours". We don’t really need that. 

The next part is "in France" which can stay the same.

Now I'm going to add some thing. I'm going to add those sources where the electricity comes from. We can see in the graph those four sources. I'm going to put those in my introduction: "using four different sources of power".

Finally we need to get the dates "between 1988 and 2012". Nice Way to change that is talking about the length of the period "over a period of 32 years". 

The full introduction is finished:

> The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.

#### **2. Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points**

The overview, two sentences two main points. We’re looking for some very general information on the graph. Let’s look at the graph again. The most general thing that I can see the main point is that the orange line for nuclear is definitely the highest over almost the whole. We’ll talk about that. 

And one more thing let’s just go to the opposite. The renewables are the lowest figures in the whole of the graph, whole of the period. 

![overview](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/overview.png)

Let’s write up in two sentences those two main points. First sentence about nuclear power being the highest:

> It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown.

Noticed that I’ve made it a bit nicer than just saying "nuclear power was the highest". I've said "in most important means of electricity generation". It’s a good phrase.

The second sentence was going to be about the renewables being the lowest. 

> Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year

And that’s my overview finished. 

Two paragraphs done.

#### **Paragraph 3**

Now we’re ready to move onto the details, paragraphs three and four in which we compare the lines in more detail at specific points. 

We need to look at the graph again and decide what to put in paragraph three.

![para3](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/para3.png)

First of all I always begin at the beginning with the first year, so I’m going to compare the four numbers in 1980 and then I’m just going to move onto this one point in 1981 when nuclear power becomes the most important the highest for the rest of the period. 

That’s all I’m going to put in paragraph three so here’s my paragraph. There are three sentences and it started with the first year as I said, and the highest number:

> **In 1980** **thermal** power stations with a main source of electricity in France generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. 

That’s the highest number in the first year, then moving on, we had a comparison with the other three sources:

> **Nuclear** and **hydroelectric** power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and **renewables** provided a negligible amount. 

"Negligible" means very low almost nothing.

So I’ve taken 1980 and mentioned all four sources of power. 

Now I just want to add one more sentence about the year 1981 

> Just one year later nuclear power overtook thermal power as the primary source of electricity.

"Overtook" means it went above. 

That’s paragraph three finished.

#### **Paragraph 4**

Onto paragraph 4, let’s go back to the graph and look at what we are going to select for paragraph 4. Remember we can just take at least one thing about each line. 

Starting with a nuclear line, I’ll just take this increase up to a peak in 2005. 

And I’ll contrast that with the thermal line the red line where we had a decrease down from its high point at the beginning.

For the blue line, we’re just going to say it’s fairly stable for most of the period or all of the period even. 

And for the green line we'll just talk about this increase at the end.

So we’ve got one thing about each line and will try and make sure that we compare or contrast when describing those numbers.

![para4](/assets/img/2023-01-02-t1l2-line-graphs/para4.png)

Again another three sentences. First:

> Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from **nuclear** power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours.

That’s my sentence about nuclear. I’m going to contrast that now with the thermal power:

> By contrast, the figure for **thermal** power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985 and remained at this level for the rest of the period.

Next:

> **Hydroelectric** power generation remained relatively stable at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours for the whole 32 year period, but **renewable** electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012. 

That’s paragraph 4 finished and we finish the whole report. It's done.

### Sample essay

The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.

It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown. 
Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. 
Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount. 
Just one year later, nuclear power overtook thermal power as the primary source of electricity.

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. 
By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period. 
Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.
